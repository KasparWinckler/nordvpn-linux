* Fixed: Rumor has it that some of you had trouble routing traffic from your Windows PC to a Linux device. That was never our intention, so we've sorted it out.
* Fixed: The tray icon used to disappear after you logged out and back into the system. We've fixed it - now it stays.
* Fixed: Sometimes the app would throw a confusing error when you tried to connect to a dedicated IP. We've tweaked the app logic to select the right server from your purchased list or show you a clear message if you're not subscribed.
* Fixed: Using a Linux device as a VPN gateway previously let LAN traffic through. Fun, right? But not very private. So now, LAN traffic won't get to the internet by default. If you want to route it through your VPN-connect device, just turn on LAN discovery or allowlist specific subnets or IP addresses.
* We've also improved how subnet allowlisting works. Accessing an allowlisted subnet or IP no longer requires LAN discovery to be active.
* A few other little bugs have been wiped out.
